# Grant Discovery Skill

## Pipeline Overview

This skill is **Stage 1** of a two-stage system:

```
Stage 1: Discovery (this file)          Stage 2: Processing (process_grant.md)
search categories 1-10  ──►  potential_new_grants.json  ──►  dedupe → validate → verify → found_grants.json
```

| File | Role | Owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `SKILLS.md` | Find grants | Search categories, queries, discovery channels |
| `process_grant.md` | Record grants | Grant schema, classification rules, duplicate rules, validation workflow |

Scripts (in `tools/`): `is_existing.py` (dedupe), `validate_grant_schema.py`, `append_verified_grants.py`.

## Purpose

## Output: Staging Entries

Discovery produces **staging entries** in `potential_new_grants.json`. Each entry uses the **Grant Entry Schema defined in [process_grant.md](process_grant.md)** (single source of truth), plus one discovery-only field:

```json
{
  "source_category": 1
}
```

`source_category` is the number (1-10) of the Search Category that surfaced the grant. It is dropped by `process_grant.md` when promoting to `found_grants.json`.

Fill what the search reveals; use `null` for unknown fields rather than guessing. Best-guess `applicant_need` and `recurring` — Stage 2 verifies them. Deadlines: `YYYY-MM-DD`, or `"Rolling"` / `"TBD"`.

After each batch, tell the user how many entries were added to `potential_new_grants.json`.

---

## Search Execution

1. **Systematic approach**: Load regional `grants/<region>/funders.json` (or scan all regions) to iterate through all curated funder portals, discovery channels, and search queries sequentially across categories 1–10
2. **Parallel where possible**: Multiple searches simultaneously
3. **Document as you go**: Append to `potential_new_grants.json` as you discover (don't batch at end)
4. **Capture metadata**: Note search queries and sources in `notes` for reproducibility
5. **Pre-filter duplicates**: Run `python tools/is_existing.py --check <entry_json>` against `found_grants.json` before staging (exact, fuzzy name/org, URL, same-organization matches)
6. **Skip expired one-time grants**: Don't stage them (see Stage 2 rules)
7. **Hand off**: When the search pass is done, run Stage 2 per [process_grant.md](process_grant.md)

## Notes

- **Not included**: Evaluation of grants, strategic fit analysis, application preparation, outreach
- **Focus**: Breadth of discovery across all categories
- **Update frequency**: Re-run quarterly (funding landscape shifts)
- **Coverage check**: After searching, analyze `found_grants.json` for gaps by geography, stage, vertical
